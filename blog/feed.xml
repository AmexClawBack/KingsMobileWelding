In April 2025, the <strong>American Welding Society (AWS)</strong> released the <strong>D1.1 / D1.1M:2025</strong> edition — and it comes with major updates for fabricators, inspectors, and contractors alike.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.kingsmobilewelding.com"><strong>Kings Mobile Welding</strong></a>, we’re proud to be <strong>AWS D1.1 certified</strong>, <strong>fully insured</strong>, and <strong>OSHA 10 trained</strong>, serving contractors and construction professionals throughout <a href=""><strong>Hampton Roads VA</strong></a> and surrounding regions.</p>

<p>This post explains what’s new in AWS D1.1:2025, how these changes affect your next project, and why working with certified welders like Kings Mobile Welding helps keep your operations compliant and efficient.</p>

<h2 id="-major-updates-in-aws-d112025">🧱 Major Updates in AWS D1.1:2025</h2>

<h3 id="1-new-prequalified-steel-grades">1. New Prequalified Steel Grades</h3>

<p>The 2025 edition adds <strong>A913 Grade 80 (Gr80)</strong> as a <strong>prequalified base metal</strong> — the strongest currently permitted under D1.1. This reduces the need for additional WPS qualification for many high-strength applications.</p>

<p>Changes also include adjustments to <strong>A913 Gr65</strong> and <strong>Gr70</strong> preheat categories, expanding flexibility for engineers and welders.

<h3 id="2-integration-of-lrfd-design-methods">2. Integration of LRFD Design Methods</h3>

<p>Clause 4.7 introduces <strong>Load &amp; Resistance Factor Design (LRFD)</strong> principles — aligning the code more closely with modern structural design practice. Welders and engineers must ensure designs and procedures match the chosen method (ASD vs LRFD).
_Source: <a href="https://blog.ansi.org/ansi/aws-d1-1-2025-structural-welding-code-steel/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">ANSI Blog</a></p>

<h3 id="3-clearer-nde--inspection-requirements">3. Clearer NDE &amp; Inspection Requirements</h3>

<p>The 2025 update refines <strong>nondestructive testing (NDE)</strong> criteria, magnetic particle (MT), and penetrant testing (PT) methods. These clarifications reduce ambiguity during inspections and align better with real-world practices.</p>

<h3 id="4-usability--clause-reorganization">4. Usability &amp; Clause Reorganization</h3>

<p>The code now features improved definitions, reorganized clauses, and clarified terminology. Many previously conflicting rules have been revised for better field interpretation and consistency.

<h2 id="-related-code-updates">🌉 Related Code Updates</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>AWS D1.5M / D1.5:2025 (Bridge Welding Code)</strong> — Aligns with D1.1:2025 changes, especially ultrasonic inspection updates.</li>
  <li><strong>AWS D1.8 / D1.8M:2025 (Seismic Supplement)</strong> — Improves clarity for welds in seismic systems (SFRS).</li>
</ul>

<p>Together, these codes strengthen compliance for contractors working in transportation, infrastructure, and structural steel sectors.</p>

<h2 id="️-why-these-updates-matter-for-contractors">🏗️ Why These Updates Matter for Contractors</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Less Requalification = Lower Costs</strong> – Expanded prequalified materials reduce the need for WPS/PQR testing.</li>
  <li><strong>Stronger Design Options</strong> – High-strength steels like A913 Gr80 allow lighter, more efficient structures.</li>
  <li><strong>Simpler Inspections</strong> – Updated NDE language streamlines compliance and documentation.</li>
  <li><strong>Future-Proof Compliance</strong> – Many new projects now specifically reference AWS D1.1:2025, so staying current prevents rework and liability.</li>

But when you need not just one or two, but <em>dozens</em> of structures, the challenges, planning, and benefits multiply.</p>

<p>At <strong>Kings Mobile Welding</strong>, we specialize in mobile welding, fabrication, and on-site manufacturing of large carport and awning systems — precisely for clients who need bulk installations across Hampton Roads and a ~75-mile radius of <strong>Newport News, VA</strong>. <a href="https://www.kingsmobilewelding.com/areas">kingsmobilewelding.com</a></p>

<h3 id="the-strategic-advantage-of-bulk-carports--awnings-for-rv-parks--businesses">The Strategic Advantage of Bulk Carports &amp; Awnings for RV Parks &amp; Businesses</h3>

<p>Installing a fleet of carports or awnings is more than “building shelter.” It’s a strategic investment in asset protection, guest experience, and long-term branding. Here are key reasons why many RV parks, marinas, and commercial clients choose to go big:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Economies of scale &amp; consistent design</strong>
When you purchase and install many units together, you reduce per-unit costs in both materials and labor. Plus, maintaining design consistency (same colors, structural style, spacing) helps your facility look polished and professional.</li>
  <li><strong>Faster build times</strong>
Pre-fabrication, modular design, and efficient site staging allow multiple bays to be erected in a compressed schedule. For commercial clients, minimizing downtime or disruption is critical.</li>
  <li><strong>Durability in demanding environments</strong>
Coastal and Virginia Tidewater climates bring humidity, storms, wind, and salt. Steel or aluminum structures, when properly coated, resist corrosion, pests, and deterioration far better than cheaper alternatives.</li>
  <li><strong>Asset protection &amp; guest satisfaction</strong>
Covered parking shields RV units, trailers, vehicles, and equipment from sun, hail, and weather damage. Guests appreciate the premium amenity, which can differentiate your park or facility.</li>
  <li><strong>Flexibility &amp; expandability</strong>
A modular carport/awning system gives you room to expand as your site grows — simply add more bays that tie into existing modules.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-it-takes-to-execute-a-bulk-installation-successfully">What It Takes to Execute a Bulk Installation Successfully</h3>

<p>For a multi-structure project, the difference between a smooth rollout and a nightmare is in the planning. Here’s how Kings Mobile Welding approaches it:</p>

<h4 id="1-site-survey--structural-assessment">1. Site Survey &amp; Structural Assessment</h4>

<p>We evaluate existing grade, soil bearing, drainage paths, and whether site modifications (cut/fill) are needed. If permitting or structural codes demand, we collaborate with local engineers.</p>

<h4 id="2-modular-structural-design">2. Modular Structural Design</h4>

<p>We standardize bay widths, roof pitch, clearance heights, and beam spans. Modular repetition makes manufacturing, transportation, and installation more efficient.</p>

<h4 id="3-permitting--code-compliance">3. Permitting &amp; Code Compliance</h4>

<p>We handle structural drawings, load calculations, and local building code submissions. Our clients across <strong>Hampton, VA</strong> and <strong>Virginia Beach, VA</strong> benefit from our experience navigating municipal permitting. <a href="https://www.kingsmobilewelding.com/areas">kingsmobilewelding.com</a></p>

<h4 id="4-off-site-fabrication--on-site-staging">4. Off-Site Fabrication + On-Site Staging</h4>

<p>We pre-cut, pre-punch, and partially assemble where possible, then stage the portions near the site. Our mobile welding teams then perform final welds or adjustments on site.</p>

<h4 id="5-sequenced-installation">5. Sequenced Installation</h4>

<p>We erect structural frames first, then add roof panels, gutters, downspouts, and finishes. Sequencing by zones avoids interfering with daily operations of the park or business.</p>

<h4 id="6-finishes-branding--utilities">6. Finishes, Branding &amp; Utilities</h4>

<p>We offer painted or powder-coated finishes, color matching, signage or branding attachments, and provisions for lighting, conduit, or solar panels.</p>

<h4 id="7-maintenance--service-contracts">7. Maintenance &amp; Service Contracts</h4>

<p>After installation, we offer inspection schedules, bolt re-tightening, re-coating services, and warranty support to ensure your investment lasts.</p>

<h3 id="real-world-use-cases--benefits">Real-World Use Cases &amp; Benefits</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>RV Parks &amp; Campgrounds</strong>
Cover dozens of slots with uniform carport structures, or build awnings for common areas, check-in lanes, or covered walkways between buildings.</li>
  <li><strong>Marinas &amp; Boat Storage</strong>
Use high-clearance canopies to shelter boats, floating docks, or fuel stations from sun, rain, and salt spray.</li>
  <li><strong>Commercial &amp; Retail Lots</strong>
Shade vehicles, enhance customer sidewalks, or create covered zones for deliveries.</li>
  <li><strong>Residential Complexes &amp; Multi-Family Units</strong>
Provide covered parking bays across multiple buildings in a uniform, scalable way.</li>

<h2 id="2-choose-a-provider-that-offers-mobile--on-site-services">2. Choose a Provider That Offers Mobile &amp; On-Site Services</h2>

<p>Time is money, especially on construction sites. Choosing a <strong>mobile welding company</strong> means less downtime and faster response times. Our team is fully equipped to perform <a href=""><strong>on-site welding and fabrication</strong></a> across the Hampton Roads area, including <a href=""><strong>Newport News</strong></a>, <a href=""><strong>Norfolk</strong></a>, <a href=""><strong>Virginia Beach</strong></a>, <a href=""><strong>Portsmouth</strong></a>, and more.</p>

<p>Our <strong>fully mobile welding rigs</strong> are equipped with engine-driven machines, torches, and fabrication tools, so we can handle most projects without needing to transport materials offsite.</p>

<h2 id="3-check-the-range-of-services-offered">3. Check the Range of Services Offered</h2>

<p>Not all welders provide the same services. The right provider should be versatile, offering solutions that cover structural, fabrication, and facility repair needs.</p>

<p>At Kings Mobile Welding, our core services include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href=""><strong>Structural Steel Welding</strong></a> for beams, bar joists, and RTU supports</li>
  <li><a href=""><strong>Facility &amp; Property Maintenance Welding</strong></a> for gates, handrails, docks, and safety upgrades</li>
  <li><a href=""><strong>Dumpster Gate Repairs</strong></a> for waste management facilities</li>
  <li><a href=""><strong>Bollard and Safety Rail Installation</strong></a> for protecting buildings and assets</li>

That’s why mobile welding is becoming essential on job sites. Instead of waiting for shop fabrication, contractors rely on <strong>on-site welding</strong> to make real-time modifications and keep projects moving forward.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.kingsmobilewelding.com"><strong>Kings Mobile Welding</strong></a>, we bring fully equipped welding rigs directly to your site — complete with engine-driven welders, plasma cutters, torch bottles, and air compressors. We handle everything from <a href=""><strong>bar-joist welding and RTU curb fabrication</strong></a> to <strong>steel stair and handrail installation</strong>, helping you stay on schedule.</p>

<h3 id="3-sustainability-and-prefabrication-are-reshaping-fabrication-work">3. Sustainability and Prefabrication Are Reshaping Fabrication Work</h3>

<p>Contractors in areas such as <a href=""><strong>Portsmouth</strong></a> and <a href=""><strong>Suffolk</strong></a> are increasingly embracing <strong>off-site prefabrication</strong> paired with <strong>on-site assembly</strong>. This approach improves quality control, reduces waste, and speeds up field installation.</p>

<p>Our <a href=""><strong>field fabrication and installation services</strong></a> give contractors the best of both worlds — the precision of shop work combined with the flexibility of mobile welding for final connections, modifications, and retrofits.</p>

<h3 id="4-facility-maintenance-welding-is-becoming-more-proactive">4. Facility Maintenance Welding Is Becoming More Proactive</h3>

<p>Property and facility managers throughout <strong>Hampton Roads, Virginia</strong> are shifting from reactive repairs to <strong>preventative maintenance welding</strong>. Regular inspections and early intervention on gates, docks, bollards, and handrails reduce liability and extend the life of critical structures.</p>

<p>We offer a wide range of <a href=""><strong>facility maintenance welding services</strong></a> — including <a href=""><strong>dumpster gate repairs</strong></a>, <a href=""><strong>bollard and safety rail installations</strong></a>, and <a href=""><strong>emergency welding services</strong></a> — designed to keep your facilities in <a href=""><strong>Norfolk</strong></a>, <a href=""><strong>Hampton</strong></a>, and beyond safe and fully operational.</p>

<p>In industrial environments—such as factories, plants, shipyards, and warehouses—<strong>welding isn’t just about getting the job done.</strong> It’s about ensuring that every weld meets <strong>strict OSHA and structural safety standards</strong> to protect workers, equipment, and the facility itself.</p>

<p>OSHA welding and cutting regulations (29 CFR 1910 Subpart Q) cover a wide range of safety protocols, including ventilation, fire protection, PPE, electrical grounding, and proper procedures for cutting and welding on steel structures. Failure to follow these standards can lead to fines, downtime, or worse—accidents and injuries.</p>

<p>👉 At <a href="https://www.kingsmobilewelding.com">Kings Mobile Welding</a>, we help industrial facilities throughout <strong>Hampton Roads, Newport News, Norfolk, Chesapeake, and Virginia Beach</strong> stay compliant and operational by bringing <strong>certified structural welding</strong> directly to your site.</p>

<h3 id="-on-site-welding-services-tailored-for-industrial-facilities">🧰 <strong>On-Site Welding Services Tailored for Industrial Facilities</strong></h3>

Below are the real reasons Kings Mobile Welding can pass savings to you — and why choosing us doesn’t mean cutting corners.</p>

<h3 id="1-minimal-overhead--lower-costs">1. Minimal Overhead = Lower Costs</h3>

<p>One of the biggest cost drivers for typical welding or fabrication companies is <strong>overhead</strong>: rent, utilities, shop maintenance, full-time staff salaries, insurance, administrative staff, and more. Traditional companies must factor <strong>a percentage of all that overhead</strong> into every job so they can stay afloat.</p>

<p>By contrast, <strong>Kings Mobile Welding is a lean operation</strong>. We run with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One mobile rig</li>
  <li>Owner as the primary operator</li>
  <li>Only occasional 1099 help when needed</li>
</ul>

<p>Because we’re not paying rent on a large facility, maintaining a big shop, or carrying a full staff all the time, we avoid a lot of fixed costs. We can therefore price more competitively.</p>

<h3 id="2-direct-sourcing-of-steel--in-house-stock">2. Direct Sourcing of Steel &amp; In-House Stock</h3>

<p>Another way we reduce costs and deliver that benefit to you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For larger jobs, we <strong>source steel directly from the mill</strong>, cutting out the middleman markup from a metal shop.</li>
  <li>We also maintain a <strong>stock of metal in-house</strong>, which means we don’t always have to wait for external suppliers or pay premium rush fees.</li>
</ul>

<p>These practices help us keep material costs down — and that translates into lower quotes for you.</p>

<h3 id="3-streamlined-job-planning-less-waste-on-budget-execution">3. Streamlined Job Planning, Less Waste, On-Budget Execution</h3>

<p>A key difference with Kings Mobile Welding is our disciplined job planning. We don’t just “wing it” — each project is carefully laid out in advance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We scope materials, cutting lists, and layouts before arriving on site</li>
  <li>We coordinate logistical steps so there’s minimal downtime or rework</li>
  <li>We optimize welding sequences to reduce travel, overhead, and idle time</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of this precision, we avoid overruns, reduce wasted material and labor, and stick as close as possible to the budget and schedule. That control means <strong>you pay less in unexpected costs</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="4-mobile-model-eliminates-extra-transport--shop-fees">4. Mobile Model Eliminates Extra Transport &amp; Shop Fees</h3>

<p>When you bring a project to a fixed shop, you often incur:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Transport/delivery costs</li>
  <li>Loading/unloading costs</li>
  <li>Fees for shop space, staging, handling</li>
</ul>

<p>With mobile welding, we bring the workshop to your location. You bypass those added charges entirely. This is a well-known cost advantage of mobile welding services. <a href="https://discountmobilewelding.com/mobile-welding-can-save-you-time/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">discountmobilewelding.com+2genesisweldingfabrication.com+2</a></p>

<p>Because we don’t maintain a permanent shop with all its expenses, we don’t have to pass along those fees to you.</p>

<h3 id="5-optimized-energy-consumables--efficient-practices">5. Optimized Energy, Consumables &amp; Efficient Practices</h3>

<p>There are more subtle ways we control costs (and many of these are industry best practices for reducing welding expenses). For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We monitor and minimize energy usage (welding power, lighting, idle time) so we’re not wasting electricity. <a href="https://bugo.com/how-to-reduce-welding-costs-without-sacrificing-quality/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Bug-O Systems</a></li>
  <li>We use consumables (wire, electrodes, shielding gas) efficiently, minimizing waste or overuse</li>
  <li>We plan cutting and nesting strategies to reduce off-cuts and scrap</li>
  <li>We prevent rework by ensuring proper fit-up, alignment, and weld prep before starting</li>
</ul>

<p>These small efficiencies across many jobs compound — allowing us to maintain high quality while keeping your cost down.</p>

<h3 id="6-transparency--no-hidden-markups">6. Transparency &amp; No Hidden Markups</h3>

<p>Many larger shops or contractors load hidden markups — for shop overhead, handling, waste, internal profit cushions, or “miscellaneous” line items. We believe in transparency. When you get a quote from us, you see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Labor cost</li>
  <li>Material cost</li>
  <li>Travel / mobilization cost</li>
  <li>Any subcontract or outside cost</li>
</ul>

<p>Because we run lean and have less internal burden, we don’t need to hide extra percentages.</p>

<h3 id="what-you-still-get--no-compromise">What You Still Get — No Compromise</h3>

<p>Just because our pricing is lower doesn’t mean quality, reliability, or professionalism suffer. With Kings Mobile Welding, you still get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AWS D1.1–caliber welds</li>
  <li>On-site or remote jobs</li>
  <li>Responsive scheduling</li>
  <li>Clean, code-compliant work</li>
  <li>Trustworthy performance</li>
</ul>

<p>We believe passing savings to the customer is our competitive edge — not underdelivering.</p>
