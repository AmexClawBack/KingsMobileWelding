Membrane, shingles, coatings — none of that matters unless the STEEL structure underneath is solid, supported, properly welded, and built to hold up to commercial loads and rooftop equipment.</p>

<p>This is where welders come in.</p>

<h3 id="what-role-does-welding-play-in-commercial-roofing">What Role Does Welding Play in Commercial Roofing?</h3>

<p>Commercial roofs rely on steel: bar joists, beams, deck panels, roof support steel, mechanical support, rooftop unit curbs, and more.</p>

<p>Welders support roofing contractors by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>welding structural bar joists in place on-site</li>
  <li>welding bridging for joist stabilization</li>
  <li>modifying steel to correct fit-up issues</li>
  <li>welding/adding support steel for RTUs</li>
  <li>torch-cutting penetrations cleanly for mechanical/electrical</li>
  <li>fabricating and installing new curb structures for equipment tie-ins</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, Kings Mobile Welding provides dedicated services for these exact needs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.kingsmobilewelding.com/services/structural/bar-joist-welding/">Bar Joist Welding</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.kingsmobilewelding.com/services/structural/rtu-curb-fabrication-welding/">RTU Curb Fabrication &amp; Welding</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These services are critical in commercial roof environments because bad welds = future problems (leaks, sagging, structural failure risk, equipment support issues, and expensive callbacks).</p>

At <a href="https://www.kingsmobilewelding.com"><strong>Kings Mobile Welding</strong></a>, we specialize in <strong>on-site AWS D1.1-certified welding and fabrication</strong> across Hampton Roads and the surrounding areas, so we know firsthand how to combat corrosion in harsh coastal environments.</p>

<h2 id="why-coastal-environments-are-so-tough-on-metal"><strong>Why Coastal Environments Are So Tough on Metal</strong></h2>

<p>Steel and aluminum structures near the ocean are constantly exposed to salt-laden air, which accelerates <strong>oxidation and pitting corrosion</strong>. According to <a href="https://blog.red-d-arc.com/corrosion-control-and-welding-in-offshore-environments-strategies-for-longevity/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Red-D-Arc</a>, salt particles carry chlorides that act as electrolytes, attacking weld joints faster than inland conditions.</p>

<p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/published-papers/corrosion-of-welded-components-in-marine-environments-april-2003?utm_source=chatgpt.com">TWI Global</a> explains that <strong>weld metal and heat-affected zones (HAZ)</strong> can develop different microstructures than the base metal, leading to localized corrosion at the weld itself. Combined with high humidity and fluctuating wet/dry cycles, this creates a perfect storm for metal deterioration.</p>

<h2 id="best-practices-for-welding-in-coastal-environments"><strong>Best Practices for Welding in Coastal Environments</strong></h2>

<h3 id="1-choose-the-right-materials"><strong>1. Choose the Right Materials</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Opt for <strong>marine-grade stainless steel (316L or duplex)</strong> for superior chloride resistance.</li>
  <li>For carbon steel, ensure a robust <strong>coating and maintenance plan</strong> is in place.</li>
  <li>Avoid dissimilar metal contact to reduce <strong>galvanic corrosion</strong> (see <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41529-023-00417-7?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Nature.com</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-design-welds-for-drainage--access"><strong>2. Design Welds for Drainage &amp; Access</strong></h3>

<p>Coastal structures benefit from <strong>continuous welds</strong>, smooth contours, and designs that prevent water trapping. The <a href="https://www.wbdg.org/dod/cpc-source/waterfront-coastal-structures-knowledge-area?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Whole Building Design Guide (WBDG)</a> recommends avoiding skip welds and lap joints that collect saltwater. Good weld geometry also allows for even coating coverage.</p>

<h3 id="3-use-proper-welding-techniques"><strong>3. Use Proper Welding Techniques</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Stick with <strong>low-hydrogen processes</strong> to minimize cracking.</li>
  <li>Thoroughly clean the weld zone before and after welding to remove spatter and contaminants.</li>
  <li>Grind and polish weld beads so coatings adhere uniformly.</li>
  <li>Ensure complete fusion and sound weld quality—defects quickly become corrosion points.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-apply-marine-grade-coatings"><strong>4. Apply Marine-Grade Coatings</strong></h3>

<p>Immediately after welding and cleaning, use <strong>epoxy primers, zinc-rich coatings, or galvanizing</strong> for protection. As <a href="https://dot.ca.gov/-/media/dot-media/programs/engineering/documents/mets/corrosion-guidelines-a11y.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Caltrans Corrosion Guidelines</a> emphasize, the coating must maintain even thickness over welds, edges, and corners—thin or skipped areas lead to early failure.</p>

<p>For extreme salt exposure (such as docks, barges, or shipyard work), consider <strong>cathodic protection systems</strong> to further slow corrosion.</p>

<h3 id="5-inspect-and-maintain-regularly"><strong>5. Inspect and Maintain Regularly</strong></h3>

<p>Routine inspections are essential. Look for rust bleed-through, coating blistering, or crevice corrosion near welds. According to <a href="https://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/published-papers/corrosion-of-welded-components-in-marine-environments-april-2003?utm_source=chatgpt.com">TWI Global</a>, regular maintenance and NDT inspections extend service life dramatically.</p>

In April 2025, the <strong>American Welding Society (AWS)</strong> released the <strong>D1.1 / D1.1M:2025</strong> edition — and it comes with major updates for fabricators, inspectors, and contractors alike.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.kingsmobilewelding.com"><strong>Kings Mobile Welding</strong></a>, we’re proud to be <strong>AWS D1.1 certified</strong>, <strong>fully insured</strong>, and <strong>OSHA 10 trained</strong>, serving contractors and construction professionals throughout <a href=""><strong>Hampton Roads VA</strong></a> and surrounding regions.</p>

<p>This post explains what’s new in AWS D1.1:2025, how these changes affect your next project, and why working with certified welders like Kings Mobile Welding helps keep your operations compliant and efficient.</p>

<h2 id="-major-updates-in-aws-d112025">🧱 Major Updates in AWS D1.1:2025</h2>

<h3 id="1-new-prequalified-steel-grades">1. New Prequalified Steel Grades</h3>

<p>The 2025 edition adds <strong>A913 Grade 80 (Gr80)</strong> as a <strong>prequalified base metal</strong> — the strongest currently permitted under D1.1. This reduces the need for additional WPS qualification for many high-strength applications.</p>

<p>Changes also include adjustments to <strong>A913 Gr65</strong> and <strong>Gr70</strong> preheat categories, expanding flexibility for engineers and welders.

<h3 id="2-integration-of-lrfd-design-methods">2. Integration of LRFD Design Methods</h3>

<p>Clause 4.7 introduces <strong>Load &amp; Resistance Factor Design (LRFD)</strong> principles — aligning the code more closely with modern structural design practice. Welders and engineers must ensure designs and procedures match the chosen method (ASD vs LRFD).
_Source: <a href="https://blog.ansi.org/ansi/aws-d1-1-2025-structural-welding-code-steel/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">ANSI Blog</a></p>

<h3 id="3-clearer-nde--inspection-requirements">3. Clearer NDE &amp; Inspection Requirements</h3>

<p>The 2025 update refines <strong>nondestructive testing (NDE)</strong> criteria, magnetic particle (MT), and penetrant testing (PT) methods. These clarifications reduce ambiguity during inspections and align better with real-world practices.</p>

<h3 id="4-usability--clause-reorganization">4. Usability &amp; Clause Reorganization</h3>

<p>The code now features improved definitions, reorganized clauses, and clarified terminology. Many previously conflicting rules have been revised for better field interpretation and consistency.

<h2 id="-related-code-updates">🌉 Related Code Updates</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>AWS D1.5M / D1.5:2025 (Bridge Welding Code)</strong> — Aligns with D1.1:2025 changes, especially ultrasonic inspection updates.</li>
  <li><strong>AWS D1.8 / D1.8M:2025 (Seismic Supplement)</strong> — Improves clarity for welds in seismic systems (SFRS).</li>
</ul>

<p>Together, these codes strengthen compliance for contractors working in transportation, infrastructure, and structural steel sectors.</p>

<h2 id="️-why-these-updates-matter-for-contractors">🏗️ Why These Updates Matter for Contractors</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Less Requalification = Lower Costs</strong> – Expanded prequalified materials reduce the need for WPS/PQR testing.</li>
  <li><strong>Stronger Design Options</strong> – High-strength steels like A913 Gr80 allow lighter, more efficient structures.</li>
  <li><strong>Simpler Inspections</strong> – Updated NDE language streamlines compliance and documentation.</li>
  <li><strong>Future-Proof Compliance</strong> – Many new projects now specifically reference AWS D1.1:2025, so staying current prevents rework and liability.</li>
</ul>

But when you need not just one or two, but <em>dozens</em> of structures, the challenges, planning, and benefits multiply.</p>

<p>At <strong>Kings Mobile Welding</strong>, we specialize in mobile welding, fabrication, and on-site manufacturing of large carport and awning systems — precisely for clients who need bulk installations across Hampton Roads and a ~75-mile radius of <strong>Newport News, VA</strong>. <a href="https://www.kingsmobilewelding.com/areas">kingsmobilewelding.com</a></p>

<h3 id="the-strategic-advantage-of-bulk-carports--awnings-for-rv-parks--businesses">The Strategic Advantage of Bulk Carports &amp; Awnings for RV Parks &amp; Businesses</h3>

<p>Installing a fleet of carports or awnings is more than “building shelter.” It’s a strategic investment in asset protection, guest experience, and long-term branding. Here are key reasons why many RV parks, marinas, and commercial clients choose to go big:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Economies of scale &amp; consistent design</strong>
When you purchase and install many units together, you reduce per-unit costs in both materials and labor. Plus, maintaining design consistency (same colors, structural style, spacing) helps your facility look polished and professional.</li>
  <li><strong>Faster build times</strong>
Pre-fabrication, modular design, and efficient site staging allow multiple bays to be erected in a compressed schedule. For commercial clients, minimizing downtime or disruption is critical.</li>
  <li><strong>Durability in demanding environments</strong>
Coastal and Virginia Tidewater climates bring humidity, storms, wind, and salt. Steel or aluminum structures, when properly coated, resist corrosion, pests, and deterioration far better than cheaper alternatives.</li>
  <li><strong>Asset protection &amp; guest satisfaction</strong>
Covered parking shields RV units, trailers, vehicles, and equipment from sun, hail, and weather damage. Guests appreciate the premium amenity, which can differentiate your park or facility.</li>
  <li><strong>Flexibility &amp; expandability</strong>
A modular carport/awning system gives you room to expand as your site grows — simply add more bays that tie into existing modules.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-it-takes-to-execute-a-bulk-installation-successfully">What It Takes to Execute a Bulk Installation Successfully</h3>

<p>For a multi-structure project, the difference between a smooth rollout and a nightmare is in the planning. Here’s how Kings Mobile Welding approaches it:</p>

<h4 id="1-site-survey--structural-assessment">1. Site Survey &amp; Structural Assessment</h4>

<p>We evaluate existing grade, soil bearing, drainage paths, and whether site modifications (cut/fill) are needed. If permitting or structural codes demand, we collaborate with local engineers.</p>

<h4 id="2-modular-structural-design">2. Modular Structural Design</h4>

<p>We standardize bay widths, roof pitch, clearance heights, and beam spans. Modular repetition makes manufacturing, transportation, and installation more efficient.</p>

<h4 id="3-permitting--code-compliance">3. Permitting &amp; Code Compliance</h4>

<p>We handle structural drawings, load calculations, and local building code submissions. Our clients across <strong>Hampton, VA</strong> and <strong>Virginia Beach, VA</strong> benefit from our experience navigating municipal permitting. <a href="https://www.kingsmobilewelding.com/areas">kingsmobilewelding.com</a></p>

<h4 id="4-off-site-fabrication--on-site-staging">4. Off-Site Fabrication + On-Site Staging</h4>

<p>We pre-cut, pre-punch, and partially assemble where possible, then stage the portions near the site. Our mobile welding teams then perform final welds or adjustments on site.</p>

<h4 id="5-sequenced-installation">5. Sequenced Installation</h4>

<p>We erect structural frames first, then add roof panels, gutters, downspouts, and finishes. Sequencing by zones avoids interfering with daily operations of the park or business.</p>

<h4 id="6-finishes-branding--utilities">6. Finishes, Branding &amp; Utilities</h4>

<p>We offer painted or powder-coated finishes, color matching, signage or branding attachments, and provisions for lighting, conduit, or solar panels.</p>

<h4 id="7-maintenance--service-contracts">7. Maintenance &amp; Service Contracts</h4>

<p>After installation, we offer inspection schedules, bolt re-tightening, re-coating services, and warranty support to ensure your investment lasts.</p>

<h3 id="real-world-use-cases--benefits">Real-World Use Cases &amp; Benefits</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>RV Parks &amp; Campgrounds</strong>
Cover dozens of slots with uniform carport structures, or build awnings for common areas, check-in lanes, or covered walkways between buildings.</li>
  <li><strong>Marinas &amp; Boat Storage</strong>
Use high-clearance canopies to shelter boats, floating docks, or fuel stations from sun, rain, and salt spray.</li>
  <li><strong>Commercial &amp; Retail Lots</strong>
Shade vehicles, enhance customer sidewalks, or create covered zones for deliveries.</li>
  <li><strong>Residential Complexes &amp; Multi-Family Units</strong>
Provide covered parking bays across multiple buildings in a uniform, scalable way.</li>

In a region like <a href=""><strong>Hampton Roads, Virginia</strong></a> — where industries rely on speed, precision, and compliance — working with the right team ensures safety, quality, and long-term savings.</p>

<p>In this guide, we’ll walk you through key factors to consider when selecting a welding contractor and why <a href="https://www.kingsmobilewelding.com"><strong>Kings Mobile Welding</strong></a> is a trusted choice for businesses, contractors, and facility managers across the region.</p>

<h2 id="1-look-for-certifications-and-qualifications">1. Look for Certifications and Qualifications</h2>

<p>A reputable welding service should have the proper industry certifications. At Kings Mobile Welding, we are <a href=""><strong>AWS D1.1 Certified</strong></a>, which means we meet strict structural welding standards. This is essential for projects involving beams, columns, and other load-bearing steel components.</p>

<p>We also maintain full insurance and follow OSHA safety protocols, ensuring every job site is compliant and protected.</p>

<h2 id="2-choose-a-provider-that-offers-mobile--on-site-services">2. Choose a Provider That Offers Mobile &amp; On-Site Services</h2>

<p>Time is money, especially on construction sites. Choosing a <strong>mobile welding company</strong> means less downtime and faster response times. Our team is fully equipped to perform <a href=""><strong>on-site welding and fabrication</strong></a> across the Hampton Roads area, including <a href=""><strong>Newport News</strong></a>, <a href=""><strong>Norfolk</strong></a>, <a href=""><strong>Virginia Beach</strong></a>, <a href=""><strong>Portsmouth</strong></a>, and more.</p>

<p>Our <strong>fully mobile welding rigs</strong> are equipped with engine-driven machines, torches, and fabrication tools, so we can handle most projects without needing to transport materials offsite.</p>

<h2 id="3-check-the-range-of-services-offered">3. Check the Range of Services Offered</h2>

<p>Not all welders provide the same services. The right provider should be versatile, offering solutions that cover structural, fabrication, and facility repair needs.</p>

<p>At Kings Mobile Welding, our core services include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href=""><strong>Structural Steel Welding</strong></a> for beams, bar joists, and RTU supports</li>
  <li><a href=""><strong>Facility &amp; Property Maintenance Welding</strong></a> for gates, handrails, docks, and safety upgrades</li>
  <li><a href=""><strong>Dumpster Gate Repairs</strong></a> for waste management facilities</li>
  <li><a href=""><strong>Bollard and Safety Rail Installation</strong></a> for protecting buildings and assets</li>
  <li><a href=""><strong>RTU Curb Fabrication &amp; Welding</strong></a> for HVAC contractors and commercial roofing teams</li>
</ul>

<p>This wide service range makes it easy to coordinate multiple project needs with one trusted partner.</p>

<h2 id="4-evaluate-experience-and-track-record">4. Evaluate Experience and Track Record</h2>

<p>Experience matters — especially when dealing with complex structural components or critical facility repairs. Kings Mobile Welding brings <strong>over 8 years of field welding and fabrication experience</strong> and more than a decade of construction knowledge to every project.</p>

<p>We work with general contractors, roofing companies, property managers, and government entities across Hampton Roads to deliver reliable, code-compliant welding services on schedule and within budget.</p>

<h2 id="5-prioritize-communication-and-professionalism">5. Prioritize Communication and Professionalism</h2>

<p>A great welding contractor doesn’t just do good work — they communicate clearly, show up on time, and keep your project moving smoothly. From the moment you <a href=""><strong>contact us</strong></a>, we provide transparent quotes, realistic timelines, and consistent updates so you always know what to expect.</p>

<h2 id="6-consider-value-not-just-price">6. Consider Value, Not Just Price</h2>

<p>It can be tempting to pick the lowest bid, but cheaper isn’t always better. A poorly done weld can lead to failures, costly repairs, and downtime. At Kings Mobile Welding, we keep costs competitive by operating with <strong>low overhead</strong> and <strong>direct steel sourcing</strong>, which means we can often offer <a href="https://www.kingsmobilewelding.com/blog/posts/why-kings-mobile-welding-can-charge-less-than-the-competition/">better pricing</a> without cutting corners.</p>

<h2 id="7-choose-a-local-expert-who-knows-the-area">7. Choose a Local Expert Who Knows the Area</h2>

<p>When you hire local, you get faster response times and a team that understands local regulations, suppliers, and jobsite logistics. Kings Mobile Welding proudly serves the entire Hampton Roads region, including:</p>
